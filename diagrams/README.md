## Available Diagrams

### 1. System Architecture (`system_architecture.md`)
- High-level system components
- Component relationships
- Core system structure
- State management integration

### 2. Development Workflow (`development_workflow.md`)
- Development process flow
- Agent collaboration
- Tool integration points
- State tracking mechanisms

### 3. Memory Bank Structure (`memory_bank_structure.md`)
- Documentation hierarchy
- Update processes
- Project rules integration
- Knowledge persistence

### 4. Tool Interactions (`tool_interactions.md`)
- Core tool relationships
- Operation types
- Data flow patterns
- System integration points

## Using These Diagrams

These diagrams are written in Mermaid markdown format, which can be rendered by many documentation tools and markdown viewers. They provide a visual reference for understanding:

- How the system is structured
- How components interact
- How data flows through the system
- How development processes work

The diagrams should be kept up to date as the system evolves to maintain accurate documentation of the system's architecture and workflows.
